          "Convenience: Screen Mirroring provides an easy way to view your Android phone screen on a larger TV screen.  \n No Network Required: Android video/image sharing is not affected by network traffic or network connectivity glitches as no connection through a router is needed. \n Device Availability: In addition to Android devices, screen mirroring reception is available on TVs and select video projectors, Blu-ray players, cable/satellite boxes, media streamers, laptops, and PCs. \n Business and Classroom Application: With an Android phone or tablet and a video projector with bridge device that support screen mirroring, you can wirelessly display a business or classroom presentation saved on your android device on a very large screen."

          "https://img.youtube.com/vi/KAM1iYhXDu8/maxresdefault.jpg",
          "You can't perform other tasks on your phone while content is mirrored. If you tap another icon or app, the content will cease playing and you will see the next function that is activated. \n Although you can screen mirror your phone to most smart TVs or using a screen-mirroring compatible bridge device that can be connected to any TV physically (preferably using HDMI), connection and setup are not guaranteed.  \n You will have the best luck if the phone/tablet is the same brand as the TV or bridge device. Examples include Samsung Android phones with Samsung TVs/Blu-ray Disc players and Kindle Fire Tablets with Fire TV sticks/Fire Edition TVs.  \n "

          "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-XzMlp_jrBs/maxresdefault.jpg",
          " Another way to view content from an Android device on TV is through Casting. Screen Mirroring and Casting are similar, but there are differences including:  \n Casting requires the Android device and TV to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. \n Casting works for photos, self-made videos, and select apps. \n While selected Cast content is playing on your TV, you can perform other tasks on your Android device at the same time or even turn it off.  \n Your Android device may require an additional app and plugging in a Chromecast on your TV before Casting can be used."
